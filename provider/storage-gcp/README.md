# Storage Service
storage-gcp is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) service that provides a set of APIs to manage the entire metadata life-cycle such as ingestion (persistence), modification, deletion, versioning and data schema.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Pre-requisites

* GCloud SDK with java (latest version)
* JDK 8
* Lombok 1.16 or later
* Maven

### Installation
In order to run the service locally or remotely, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

| name | value | description | sensitive? | source |
| ---  | ---   | ---         | ---        | ---    |
| `LOG_PREFIX` | `storage` | Logging prefix | no | - |
| `SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXPATH` | `/api/storage/v2/` | Servlet context path | no | - |
| `AUTHORIZE_API` | ex `https://entitlements.com/entitlements/v1` | Entitlements API endpoint | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `LEGALTAG_API` | ex `https://legal.com/api/legal/v1` | Legal API endpoint | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `PUBSUB_SEARCH_TOPIC` | ex `records-changed` | PubSub topic name | no | https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic |
| `REDIS_GROUP_HOST` | ex `127.0.0.1` | Redis host for groups | no | https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances |
| `REDIS_STORAGE_HOST` | ex `127.0.0.1` | Redis host for storage | no | https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances |
| `STORAGE_HOSTNAME` | ex `os-storage-dot-opendes.appspot.com` | Hostname | no | - |
| `GOOGLE_AUDIENCES` | ex `*****.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Client ID for getting access to cloud resources | yes | https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | ex `/path/to/directory/service-key.json` | Service account credentials, you only need this if running locally | yes | https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts |
| `PARTITION_API` | ex `http://localhost:8081/api/partition/v1` | Partition service endpoint | no | - |

###Requirements for requests.
Record identifiers cannot contain a space character. 
At the same time, they may contain a % character, which, when combined with subsequent numeric characters, 
may cause the application to misinterpret that combination.
For example, the "%20" combination will be interpreted as a space " " character. 
To correctly transfer such an identifier, you should additionally perform the url-encode operation on it. 
This functionality can be built into the front-end application, or you can use an online url-encoder 
tool ( eg.: https://www.urlencoder.org/).
Thus, having ID "osdu:work-product-component--WellboreMarkerSet:3D%20Kirchhoff%20DepthMigration" (with %20 combination) 
you should url-encode it and request 
"osdu%3Awork-product-component--WellboreMarkerSet%3A3D%2520Kirchhoff%2520DepthMigration" instead.


### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>community-maven-via-private-token</id>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <!-- The generated token expires on or before 11/14/2019 -->
             <configuration>
              <httpHeaders>
                  <property>
                      <name>Private-Token</name>
                      <value>${env.COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN}</value>
                  </property>
              </httpHeaders>
             </configuration>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```
* Update the Google cloud SDK to the latest version:

```bash
gcloud components update
```
* Set Google Project Id:

```bash
gcloud config set project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
```

* Perform a basic authentication in the selected project:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

* Navigate to storage service's root folder and run:

```bash
mvn clean install   
```

* If you wish to see the coverage report then go to target\site\jacoco\index.html and open index.html

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
cd provider/storage-gcp/ && mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Testing

 | `DEPLOY_ENV` | `empty` | Required but not used, should be set up with string "empty"| no | - |
 | `DOMAIN` | ex`opendes-gcp.projects.com` | OSDU R2 to run tests under | no | - |
 | `INTEGRATION_TESTER` | `********` | Service account base64 encoded string for API calls. Note: this user must have entitlements configured already | yes | https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts |
 | `LEGAL_URL` | ex`http://localhsot:8080/api/legal/v1/` | Legal API endpoint | no | - |
 | `NO_DATA_ACCESS_TESTER` | `********` | Service account base64 encoded string without data access | yes | https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts |
 | `PUBSUB_TOKEN` | `****` | ? | no | - |
 | `STORAGE_URL` | ex`http://localhost:8080/api/storage/v2/` | Endpoint of storage service | no | - |
 | `TENANT_NAME` | ex `opendes` | OSDU tenant used for testing | no | -- |
 
 **Entitlements configuration for integration accounts**
 
 | INTEGRATION_TESTER | NO_DATA_ACCESS_TESTER | 
 | ---  | ---   |
 | users<br/>service.entitlements.user<br/>service.storage.admin<br/>service.storage.creator<br/>service.storage.viewer<br/>service.legal.admin<br/>service.legal.editor<br/>data.test1<br/>data.integration.test | users<br/>service.entitlements.user<br/>service.storage.admin |
 
 Execute following command to build code and run all the integration tests:
 
 ```bash
 # Note: this assumes that the environment variables for integration tests as outlined
 #       above are already exported in your environment.
 # build + install integration test core
 $ (cd testing/storage-test-core/ && mvn clean install)
 ```
 ```bash
 # build + run GCP integration tests.
 $ (cd testing/storage-test-gcp/ && mvn clean test)
 ```
